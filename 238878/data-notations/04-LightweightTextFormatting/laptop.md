# Laptop

### [Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#)

A **_laptop_ computer** or **notebook computer**, also known as a **_laptop_** or **notebook**, is a small, portable [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer) (PC).  
Laptops typically have a [clamshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamshell_design) [form factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_factor_(design)) with a [flat-panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-panel_display) [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor) on the inside of the upper lid and an [alphanumeric keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology) and [pointing device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_device) on the inside of the lower lid.

Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in [webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam) at the top of the screen, and some even feature a [touchscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen) display.  
In most cases, unlike [tablet computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer) which run on [mobile operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system), laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for [desktop computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer).

### [Types of laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#Types_of_laptops)

#### [Smaller and larger laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#Smaller_and_larger_laptops)

There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included _"notebook"_ and _"subnotebook"_ models, low cost _"netbooks"_, and _"ultra-mobile PCs"_ where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and _"Desktop replacement"_ laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware.  
All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a _"gaming laptop"_ or a _"mobile workstation"_ for professional use.

#### [Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#Convertible,_hybrid,_2-in-1)

The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types.  
The _hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s_ emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.

#### [Rugged laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#Rugged_laptop)

A _rugged laptop_ is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.

### Hardware

The **basic components** of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.
