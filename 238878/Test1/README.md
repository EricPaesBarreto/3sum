## Introduction
Food and drink are an essential part of life, they provide the necessary energy and nutrients for living organisms to exist. In the modern human lifestyle there are many different ways to procure food and drink. One business type thrives on the basic needs of human beings by providing food and drink in exchange for monetary gain.

This business type can come in many forms: super-markets and grocery-stores provide fresh-often pre-cooked food, or drink, or provide the ingredients necessary to prepare food, or drink, at home. Restaurants provide freshly prepared food and drink, or meals, with ingredents they buy from producers. They then sell the food at a marked-up price to increase profit.

A sub-category of the restaurant is the so-called 'restaurant-chain'. The restaurant chain operates on a much larger scale than the conventional restaurant, usually with a standardized menu and fixed-prices.
A big draw of the restaurant-chain business to customers is the convinience and standardization of the dining experience that they provide. Customers can always expect the same, or similar, menu-items, prices, and atmosphere. It is important to note that menues differ across international-locations due to regional restrictions and cultural values.
